SYNTH-13#1 Warning
combinational multiplier  
Detected combinational multiplier in DSP instance rgb/addr2.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_25m_clk_VGA and clk_35m_clk_VGA_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_25m_clk_VGA] -to [get_clocks clk_35m_clk_VGA_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_35m_clk_VGA_1 and clk_25m_clk_VGA are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_35m_clk_VGA_1] -to [get_clocks clk_25m_clk_VGA]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT clock/mclk_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
